# WarcraftLogsLink
 
A very simple WoW Classic Era addon with zero configuration as I doubt many people will use this.
Right click a player unitframe or username in chat to copy their Warcraft Logs url.

Should you want to use this in different regions outside of US, You can modify line 8:
local region = "us"
To your desired region.
